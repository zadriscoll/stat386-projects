### 3 Key Things to Know Before Presenting Data:
As data scientists, sometimes we get over excited when we finish our number crunching. At this moment we want to shout "eurika" and share it with the world, but we forget that not everyone can interpret what we can from data. When it comes to sharing your findings with the world, it is important to remember your audience. Not everyone understands what you might understand. For example, a p-value might mean nothing to someone who does not understand what a p-value indicates. It is imperative to understand how to translate your data to a reasonable language so that everyone can learn and apply your conclusions to move in the right direction. Today we will discover 3 key takeaways that we will immediately improve your presenting skills. 

### Know Your Audience

###### *In this figure, you can see how a data scientist might breeze over type I or type II without explaining to someone what those actually mean*

Imagine you are giving a huge presentation on an analysis that your boss wanted you to explore. You get through the whole thing and are beaming with excitement, only to find that your boss asks you, "What does a coefficient of correlation mean?". You soon realized that you had said that term over a dozen times throughout your explanation without really explaining what it is or what the value indicates. In reality, unless you understand what your audience is truly wanting to discover, you might present it in a way that doesn't make sense or doesn't answer the intended question. The need to translate your code to understandable language is imperative. Knowing your audience means knowing the extent of their knowledge and what they will take away from the information you give them. If your boss understands what a standard deviation indicates, then you would not not need to explain that. On the reverse, if you are presenting to other data scientists, you can clearly use chunks of code and terminology with limited explanation as to what a specific number inidcates about the data being analyzed. Knowing your audience is the key to transmitting your insights and implementing them into day to day life. 

### Data Visualization
The number one way to grab interest and hold it is through visuals. We live in a day and age where the technology that we have access to can produce intricate graphs and visuals. BEWARE, do not rely soly on graphical information to relay the message. In some cases, the information displayed on a graph is just as illegible as a chunk of code to some people. It is important to have designs that are understandable and have a clear explanation of what each visual is indicating.

### Story Telling
Lastly, the information you share has to be relevant to people lives or there will be no lasting effect.
